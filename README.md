### Given more time

- Add e2e or contract tests for the API 
- Improve UI/UX - Improve how the data is shown on screen

- Make a client side request to the API to get the launches with the filters and sorting applied 
- Add husky pre commit/push hooks to run linting, tests and build
- Create pipeline scripts 
- Create a docker image for deployment
